- ğŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @srishtirajeev. I'm currently studying bioinformatics, info sci/data sci, psychology, and MCB at the University of Arizona. I have free tuition might as well max it out
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI, bioinformatics, medicine, geospatial sensing, biophysics, consciousness, and especially neurotech.
- Outside of the STEM fields, catch me playing badminton, writing on substack, hiking when it is not 982798728972 degrees out, and hopelessly trying to be a polygot.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ML, bioinformatics pipelines, computational neuro, and more > : )

- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her (also very/tired)

I walked into a street sign head-on the first day of school.
